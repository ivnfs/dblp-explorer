#!One-way, dataflow constraints are commonly used in graphical interface toolkits, programming environments, and circuit applications. Previous papers on dataflow constraints have focused on the design and implementation of individual algorithms. In contrast, this article focuses on the lessons we have learned from a decade of implementing competing algorithms in the Garnet and Amulet graphical interface toolkits. These lessons reveal the design and implementation tradeoffs for different one-way, constraint satisfaction algorithms. The most important lessons we have learned are that (1) mark-sweep algorithms are more efficient than topological ordering algorithms; (2) lazy and eager evaluators deliver roughly comparable performance for most applications; and (3) constraint satisfaction algorithms have more than adequate speed, except that the storage required by these algorithms can be problematic.

#!Although hypertext research and development didn't continue exactly in the directions that Frank Halasz predicted in 1988 and 1991, much of his analysis and agenda is still valid. The most interesting development is the shift away from hypertext systems as applications software to either embedded functionality or information structuring. The focus on standards and protocols has led to progress on Halasz's issues and has made hypertext almost universal. On the other hand, the ubiquity of hypertext on the Web is a force that works against some of Halasz's agenda. It is difficult to tailor or extend a hypertext because the task requires knowledge of the tools, the information structures, and the content.

#!Recommender systems selectively circulate information enriched with comments and feedback based on people's experience. These systems filter information in a semi-automatic and high-quality way in order to support a community during their work or leisure practices. However recommender systems are usually separate tools that require a degree of effort to be used, both when receiving information and to insert new feedback. In this paper we present our informal experiences with the use of multiple user interfaces (interactive large screen, email, paper and PDA) as means to improve the diffusion of information through an organizational unit and to improve access to information stored within an existing recommender system

#!Some compilation systems, such as offline partial evaluators and selective dynamic compilation systems, support staged optimizations. A staged optimization is one where a logically single optimization is broken up into stages, with the early stage(s) performing preplanning set-up work, given any available partial knowledge about the program to be compiled, and the final stage completing the optimization. The final stage can be much faster than the original optimization by having much of its work performed by the early stages. A key limitation of current staged optimizers is that they are written by hand, sometimes in an ad hoc manner. We have developed a framework called the Staged Compilation Framework (SCF) for systematically and automatically converting single-stage optimizations into staged versions. The framework is based on a combination of aggressive partial evaluation and dead-assignment elimination. We have implemented SCF in Standard ML. A preliminary evaluation shows that SCF can speed up classical optimization of some commonly used C functions by up to 12&times; (and typically between 4.5&times; and 5.5&times;).

#!Role-based access control is a powerful and policy-neutral concept for enforcing access control. Many extensions have been proposed, the most significant of which are the decentralised administration of role-based systems and the enforcement of constraints. However, the simultaneous integration of these extensions can cause conflicts in a later system implementation. We demonstrate how we use the Alloy language for the specification of a conflict-free role-based system. This specification provides us at the same time with a suitable basis for further analysis by the Alloy constraint analyser.

#!Control of variability in the back end of the line, and hence in interconnect performance as well, has become extremely difficult with the introduction of new materials such as copper and low-k dielectrics. Uniformity of chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP) requires the addition of area fill geometries into the layout, in order to smoothen the variation of feature densities across the die. Our work addresses the following smoothness gap in the recent literature on area fill synthesis. (1)The very first paper on the filling problem (Kahng et al., ISPD98 [7]) noted that there is potentially a large difference between the optimum window densities in fixed dissections vs. when all possible windows in the layout are considered. (2)Despite this observation, all filling methods since 1998 minimize and evaluate density variation only with respect to a fixed dissection. This paper gives the first evaluation of existing filling algorithms with respect to "gridless" ("floating-window") mode, according to both the effective and spatial density models. Our experiments indicate surprising advantages of Monte-Carlo and greedy strategies over "optimal" linear programming (LP) based methods. Second, we suggest new, more relevant methods of measuring a local uniformity based on Lipschitz conditions, and empirically demonstrate that Monte-Carlo methods are inherently better than LP with respect to the new criteria. Finally, we propose new LP-based filling methods that are directly driven by the new criteria, and show that these methods indeed help close the "smoothness gap".

#!The multimodal nature of speech is often ignored in human-computer interaction, but lip deformations and other body motion, such as those of the head, convey additional information. We integrate speech cues from many sources and this improves intelligibility, especially when the acoustic signal is degraded. This paper shows how this additional, often complementary, visual speech information can be used for speech recognition. Three methods for parameterizing lip image sequences for recognition using hidden Markov models are compared. Two of these are top-down approaches that fit a model of the inner and outer lip contours and derive lipreading features from a principal component analysis of shape or shape and appearance, respectively. The third, bottom-up, method uses a nonlinear scale-space analysis to form features directly from the pixel intensity. All methods are compared on a multitalker visual speech recognition task of isolated letters.

#!This paper deals with the problem of shape-based retrieval in time-series databases. The shape-based retrieval is defined as the operation that searches for the (sub)sequences whose shapes are similar to that of a given query sequence. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient approach for shape-based retrieval of subsequences. We first introduce a new similarity model for shape-based retrieval that supports various combinations of transformations such as shifting, scaling, moving average, and time warping. For efficient processing of the shape-based retrieval, we also propose the indexing and query processing methods. To verify the superiority of our approach, we perform extensive experiments with the real-world S&P 500 stock data. The results reveal that our approach successfully finds all the subsequences that have the shapes similar to that of the query sequence, and also achieves significant speedup over the sequential scan method.

#!A minimum distance search engine (MDSE) is presented as a hardware accelerator for various exhaustive pattern-matching systems. This chip executes highly parallel computations of L1 -norms between an input query and stored multiple reference records, and searches for the minimum distance among them in a highly parallel fashion. Our architectural-level estimation shows that this MDSE can reduce energy dissipation by orders of magnitude as the number of records increases, compared with the conventional systems. We have designed a prototype 4-bit 8-word MDSE composed of merged memory logic (MML) and digital/analog-mixed winner-take-all circuit (DAM-WTAC) by using hybrid digital/analog circuit techniques. It was fabricated with a 0.6-&mgr;m single-poly triple-metal CMOS technology. Experimental results show that our chip works properly at 3 V/10 MHz and has approximately four times larger throughput as well as four times higher energy efficiency, compared with the existing 8-bit microcontrollers.

#!There has been a great deal of work over the past decade on inferring semantic information from text corpora. This paper is another instance of this kind of work, but is also slightly different in that we are interested not in extracting semantic information per se, but rather real-world knowledge. In particular, given a description of a particular action --- e.g. John was eating breakfast --- we want to know where John is likely to be, what time of day it is, and so forth. Humans on hearing this sentence would form a mental image that makes a lot of inferences about the environment in which this action occurs: they would probably imagine someone in their kitchen in the morning, perhaps in their dining room, seated at a table, eating a meal.We propose a method that makes use of Dunning's likelihood ratios to extract from text corpora strong associations between particular actions and locations or times when those actions occur. We also present an evaluation of the method. The context of this work is a text-to-scene conversion system called WordsEye, where in order to depict an action such as John was eating breakfast, it is desirable to make reasonable inferences about where and when that action is taking place so that the resulting picture is a reasonable match to one's mental image of the action.

#!A major achievement of mechanism design theory is the family of truthful mechanisms often called VCG (named after Vickrey, Clarke and Groves). Although these mechanisms have many appealing properties, their essential intractability prevents them from being applied to complex problems like combinatorial auctions. In particular, VCG mechanisms require the agents to fully describe their valuation functions to the mechanism. Such a description may require exponential size and thus be infeasible for the agents.A natural approach for this problem is to introduce an intermediate language for the description of the valuations. Such a language must be succinct to both the agents and the mechanism. Unfortunately, the resulting mechanisms are neither truthful nor do they satisfy individual rationality.This paper suggests a general method for overcoming this difficulty. Given an intermediate language and an algorithm for computing the results, we propose three different mechanisms, each more powerful than its predecessor, but also more time consuming. Under reasonable assumptions, the results of our mechanisms are at least as good as the results of the algorithm on the actual valuations. All of our mechanisms have polynomial computational time and satisfy individual rationality.

#!A Bluetooth ad hoc network can be formed by interconnecting piconets into scatternets. The constraints and properties of Bluetooth scatternets present special challegnes in forming an ad hoc network efficiently. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of a new randomized distributed Bluetooth scatternet formation protocol. Our simulations validate the theoretical results that our scatternet formation protocol runs in O(log n) time and sends O(n) messages. The scatternets formed have the following properties: 1) any device is a member of at most two piconets, and 2) the number of piconets is close to be optimal. These properties can avoid overloading of any single device and lead to low interference between piconets. In addition, the simulations show that the scatternets formed have O(log n) diameter. As an essential part of the scatternet formation protocol, we study the problem of device discovery: establishing multiple connecitons with many masters and slaves in parallel. We investigate the collision rate and time requirement of the inquiry and page processes. Deducing from the simulation results of scatternet formation and device discovery, we can verify that the total number of packets sent is O(n) and demonstrate that the maximum number of packets sent by any single device is O(log n). At last, we give estimates of the total time requirement of the protocol and suggest further improvements

#!From the Book: Official Advanced PowerBuilder 6: The Definitive Guide is a new and different approach to this powerful program Official Advanced PowerBuilder 6: The Definitive Guide is a new and different approach to this powerful program. I have tried to construct this book in a fashion that provides a comprehensive look into the features of PowerBuilder 6. It was not my intention to offer a replacement for the PowerBuilder documentation, but rather to provide an additional resource to help you extend your knowledge base, become more proficient, and even exceed your goals. PowerBuilder has so many features and so much potential for enhancing your applications that it can be quite overwhelming to try to master them all at once. Therefore, in this book I have tried to cover PowerBuilderÂ’s features in a way that allows you to focus specifically on information most appropriate and timely for your particular needs. I am assuming that you are somewhat familiar with PowerBuilder. However, if you are a newcomer to the program, this book will introduce you to the concepts behind client/server development and to the most efficient ways of using PowerBuilder to develop and deploy GUI applications. On the other hand, if you are an advanced developer, youÂ’ll probably be particularly interested in finding solutions to problems and scenarios youÂ’ve frequently encountered in your applications. I have divided this book into seven parts. Part I basically provides an overview on PowerBuilder and defines some of the industry buzzwords. Part II gets into the development phase; IÂ’ve covered some of the most common objects and classes used during development, including windows, controls, DataWindows, User objects, printing, SQL, and debugging. Part III discusses more advanced topics such as external interfaces, dynamic DataWindows, OLE, MAPI, and version control. In Part IV, I have described database connectivity in detail. YouÂ’ll learn about ODBC, PowerBuilderÂ’s database interfaces, Sybase SQL Anywhere, and the Adaptive Server Enterprise. Part V covers creating executables, as well as deploying and executing your applications. Part VI is all about administration: youÂ’ll learn performance and fine-tuning tips, how to use Data Pipeline objects, and how to create Help files. Part VII, the final part, is a comprehensive section, focusing on distributed computing, building Web servers, PFCs, internationalization, other class libraries, and various third-party and Sybase tools. In a nutshell, most PowerBuilder features are explored in great detail. I wanted this book to be a technical session between you and me, so I have tried to get straight to the point and have skipped some of the basics. I have also had the benefit of input from four of SybaseÂ’s Senior Technical Consultants, who assisted with various chapters of the book. All in all, I think youÂ’ll find this book friendly, readable, filled with juicy tidbits, and packed with information that can be used in a real enterprise application. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I have enjoyed writing it. The ACM Portal is published by the Association for Computing Machinery. Copyright Â© 2010 ACM, Inc.

#!With the increasing popularity of the Web the problem of maintaining coherence of information contained in a vast collection of semantically related web pages has become a significant challenge. A fundamental issue is that an object exposed on a web page is independently and autonomously managed by the organizational unit responsible for its production and controlling the way it changes, but the same object is also needed (and visible) at web pages managed by different and independent organizational units. The aim is therefore to define a flexible but effective mechanism to automatically keep the representations of the same piece of information aligned in the various web pages.In this paper we discuss a formal model supporting this goal, which derives from practical experiences and from their formalization in the area of supporting coherence maintenance in the underlying legacy databases of cooperating organizations.

#!Distributed optimal traffic engineering in the presence of multiple paths has been found to be a difficult problem to solve. In this paper, we introduce a new approach in an attempt to tackle this problem. This approach has its basis in nonlinear control theory. More precisely, it relies on the concept of Sliding Modes. We develop a family of control laws, each of them having the property that the steady-state network resource allocation yields the maximum of the given utility function, subject to the network resource constraints. These control laws not only allow each ingress node to independently adjust its traffic sending rate but also provide a scheme for optimal traffic load redistribution among multiple paths. The only nonlocal information needed is binary feedback from each congested node in the path. Moreover, the algorithms presented are applicable to a large class of utility functions, namely, utility functions that can be expressed as the sum of concave functions of the sending rates. We show that the technique can be applied not only to rate adaptive traffic with multiple paths, but also to assured service traffic with multiple paths. Preliminary case studies show that this technique is potentially very useful for optimal traffic engineering in a multiple-class-of-service and multiple-path enabled Internet, e.g., differentiated services enabled multi-protocol label switching networks.

#!Currently the evaluation of the feasibility of general-purpose ontologies and upper-level models is expensive mostly because of technical problems such as different representation formalisms and terminologies used. Additionally, there are no formal mappings between the upper-level ontologies that could ease any kind of studies and comparisons. We present the OntoMap Project (http://www.OntoMap.org), a project with the pragmatic goal to facilitate the access, understanding, and reuse of such resources. A semantic framework on the conceptual level is implemented that is small and easy enough to be learned on-the-fly. We tried to design the framework so that it captures most of the semantics usually encoded in upper-level models. Technically, OntoMap is a web-site providing access to several upper-level ontologies and manual mapping between them.

#!A novel access structure for similarity search in metric databases, called Similarity Hashing (SH), is proposed. It is a multi-level hash structure, consisting of search-separable bucket sets on each level. The structure supports easy insertion and bounded search costs, because at most one bucket needs to be accessed at each level for range queries up to a pre-defined value of search radius. At the same time, the pivot-based strategy significantly reduces the number of distance computations. Contrary to tree organizations, the SH structure is suitable for distributed and parallel implementations.

#!In distributed and vectorized computing there is a large number of highly different supercomputing platforms an application could run on. Therefore most traditional parallel codes are ill equipped to collect data about their resource usage or their behavior at run time and the corresponding data are rarely published and few scientists attack the planning of an application and its platform systematically. As an improvement over the current state of the art, we propose an integrated approach to performance evaluation, modeling and prediction for different platforms. Our approach uses a combination of analytical modeling and systematically designed experimentation with full application runs, reduced application kernels and some benchmarks. We studied our methodology of performance assessment with Opal, an example code in molecular biology, developed at our institution to run on our four Cray J90 ``Classic" Vector SMPs. Besides a detailed assessment of performance achieved on the J90s, the primary goal of our study was to find the most suitable and most cost effective hardware platform for the application, in particular to check the suitability of this application for slow CoPs, SMP CoPs and fast CoPs, three flavors of Clusters of PCs built with off-the-shelf Intel Pentium processors. A performance assessment based on our model is much easier than porting and parallelizing the application for a new target machine and so we could easily obtain and include performance estimates for a T3E-900, a high end MPP system. The predicted execution times and speedup figures indicate that a well designed cluster of PCs achieves similar if not better performance than the J90 vector processors currently used and that the computational efficiency compares favorably to the T3E-900 for that particular application code.

Our approach also includes novel highlighting in the full representation of documents, as well as techniques to help users smoothly transition from the overview to the full representation of the document. We present a specific implementation of our design for Web browsing. We also present a qualitative user study that indicates that our perceptual design principles are effective and that users prefer our interface to traditional "find" and highlighting techniques. Our user study additionally reveals interesting tasks and strategies supported in our framework that have implications for overview+detail document interfaces in general

#!Discount usability evaluation methods have recently been introduced as a way to assess groupware systems. However, one criticism of these techniques is that they do not make use of information about users and their work contexts. To address this problem, we developed groupware walkthrough, a new usability inspection technique for groupware. The technique is a substantive modification of cognitive walkthrough to include consideration for the complexities of teamwork. The two components of groupware walkthrough are a task model for identifying and analysing real-world collaborative tasks, and a walkthrough process for assessing a system's support for those tasks. Groupware walkthrough is a low-cost technique that can identify collaboration-specific usability problems and can find problems that would not be revealed through other inspection methods

#*Agile software development
#@Alistair Cockburn
#t2002
#cThe Addison Wesley Agile Software Development Series
#index613280
#!Software development paradigms are shifting. The development group's "team" ability, and the effects of the individual developer, become more important as organizations recognize that the traditional approach of increasing process pressure and overworking team members is not getting the job done. The pioneers of Agile methodologies question the preconceived processes within which development teams work. Rather than adding to the burden of the individual developer, Agile asks "how can we change the process so that the team is more productive, while also improving quality?" The answer is in learning to play the "game." Written for developers and project managers, Agile Software Development compares software development to a game. Team members play the game knowing that the ultimate goal is to win---always remembering what they have learned along the way, and always keeping in mind that they will never play the same way twice. Players must keep an open mind to different methodologies, and focus on the goal of developing quality software in a short cycle time.

Although the book is geared toward applications in game development, many of the topics appeal to general interests in 3D graphics. It starts at a fairly basic level in areas such as vector geometry and linear algebra, and then progresses to more advanced topics in 3D game programming such as illumination and visibility determination. Particular attention is given to derivation of key results, ensuring that the reader is not forced to endure gaps in the theory. The book assumes a working knowledge of trigonometry and calculus, but also includes sections that review the important tools used from these disciplines, such as trigonometry identities, differential equations, and the Taylor series.

#!From the Book:SQL is the most widely used database language. Whether you are an application developer, database administrator, Web application designer, or Microsoft Office user, a good working knowledge of SQL is an important part of interacting with databases. There are lots of SQL books out there. Some are actually very good. But they all have one thing in common: For most users they teach just too much information. Instead of teaching SQL itself, most books teach everything from database design and normalization to relational database theory and administrative concerns. Although those are all important topics, they are not of interest to most of us who just need to learn SQL. That is where this book comes in. Sams Teach Yourself SQL in 10 Minutes will teach you SQL, starting with simple data retrieval and working on to more complex topics including the use of joins, subqueries, and table constraints. You'll learn what you need to know methodically, systematically, and simply-in lessons that will each take 10 minutes or less to complete. So turn to Lesson 1, and get to work. You'll be writing world-class SQL in no time at all. Who is the Teach Yourself SQL book for? This book is for you if: You are new to SQL. You want to quickly learn how to get the most out of SQL. You want to do things quickly and easily in SQL without having to call someone for help. Conventions Used in This Book This book uses different typefaces to differentiate between code and regular English, and also to help you identify important concepts. Text that you type and text that should appear on your screen is presented in monospace type. It willlook like this to mimic the way text looks on your screen. Placeholders for variables and expressions appear in monospace italic font You should replace the placeholder with the specific value it represents. This arrow at the beginning of a line of code means that a single line of code is too long to fit on the printed page. Continue typing all characters after the as though they were part of the preceding line. New Term icons provide clear definitions of new, essential terms. The term appears in italic. The Input icon identifies code that you can type in yourself. It usually appears next to a listing. The Output icon highlights the output produced by running a program. It usually appears after a listing. The Analysis icon alerts you to the author's line-by-line analysis of a program.

#!Traditional multiprocessor scheduling schemes have been one of either space-sharing or time-sharing. Space-sharing schemes perform better than time-sharing at low to moderate system loads. However, they have a disadvantage of wasting processing power within partitions at medium to high system loads. Time sharing schemes tend to perform better at medium to high system loads. Almost all the scheduling schemes proposed so far have been tested under ad hoc workload considerations. In light of recent knowledge about workloads, it is imperative to develop an integrated scheduling scheme that combines the advantages of space- and time-sharing while overcoming their individual drawbacks. We propose such a scheduling scheme, called Hierarchical Scheduling Policy, which is efficient as well as general enough to accommodate multiple workloads. Simulation results indicate that our scheme significantly outperforms the best space- and time-sharing mechanisms at medium to high system loads even in the absence of knowledge regarding individual job characteristics.

#!Fair queueing in the wireless domain poses significant challenges due to unique issues in the wireless channel such as location-dependent and bursty channel errors. In this paper, we present a wireless fair service model that captures the scheduling requirements of wireless scheduling algorithms, and present a unified wireless fair queueing architecture in which scheduling algorithms can be designed to achieve wireless fair service. We map seven recently proposed wireless fair scheduling algorithms to the unified architecture, and compare their properties through simulation and analysis. We conclude that some of these algorithms achieve the properties of wireless fair service including short-term and long-term fairness, short-term and long-term throughput bounds, and tight delay bounds for channel access.

#!In this paper we present an efficient decoupling model for on-chip interconnect analysis. This model decouples multiple RLC transmission lines into independent lines with separate drivers and receivers. Based on this model we propose an efficient algorithm to solve the far end responses of multiple RLC lines. Experiments show good matching between our decoupling model and SPICE simulation. Based on the model, we further develop an Nmax algorithm to quickly determine the noise amplitudes of far end responses. Experiments show that Nmax algorithm gives conservative but reasonably accurate results compared to SPICE simulation.

#*Wide Area Network Performance and Optimization: Practical Strategies for Success, 1st edition

#!:This book provides a practical approach to the optimization of performance in Wide Area Networks. It covers all the main communications protocols and technologies likely to be used over wide areas, from simple asynchronous modems to ATM. It describes the type of performance that can be expected, the parameters that affect performance and how they can be tuned. The treatment of network performance is non-mathematical for maximum accessibility and the range of protocols covered is wide for maximum reference value. This book is roughly structured on OSI layers, with chapters concentrating on link level protocols, network level, transport level, routing and applications; covers issues including: the optimization of packet window sizes, the treatment of mixed interactive and file transfer traffic, mixed protocol networks and prioritization and what to do when these factors involve trade-offs between processor and memory; covers applications ranging from the traditional IP and IPX to the modern MPEG compressed video standards; has separate chapters on network management and design tools, and on the use of public networks; and includes an appendix of mathematical techniques implicit in optimization. This book will interest networking professionals responsible for the design, implementation and operation of communication networks: network managers and operators, network designers, consultants, network engineers and technical support personnel.
