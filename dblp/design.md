My design prompts the user for an input to find their personalized search by asking for a keyword and a tier number. Then it takes in all the data from the input file and arranges them accordingly in an array of each subjects, then looks for the keywords and prioritizes the tiers from 1, 2, 3, 0, with one being the highest prioritized tier. After finding data that meets the qualifications, it prints to the user so they can find data suited to their needs.
